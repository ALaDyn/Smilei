# sim_units: normalisation units for the input data
#            it is used only in the input data & log file
#            codes outputs are always in "normalised" units
#            wavelength = input data are in wavelength-related units
#            normalized = input data are put in code (relativistic) units

# dim: Geometry of the simulation
#      1d3v = cartesian grid with 1d in space + 3d in velocity

# SIMULATION TIME 
# either use the resolution (res_time) or time-step (timestep)

# mean_velocity: mean velocity of the species (3D vector) in units of the light velocity
# temperature: temperature of the species in units of m_e c^2
# dynamics_type: species type of dynamics = norm or rrLL
# time_frozen: time during which the particles are frozen in units of the normalization time
# radiating: boolean, if true incoherent radiation are calculated using the Larmor formula
