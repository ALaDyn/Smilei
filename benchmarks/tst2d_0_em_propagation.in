# sim_units: normalisation units for the input data
#            it is used only in the input data & log file
#            codes outputs are always in "normalised" units

#            normalized = input data are put in code (relativistic) units

# SIMULATION TIME

# LASER PROPERTIES
# ----------------
#
# for each laser define:
# a0: maximum amplitude of the laser electric field (in units of the normalization field)
# angle: angle (in degree) at which the laser enters the simulation box
# delta: polarization parameter, (0:y) (1:z) (0.707106781:circ)
# time_profile: string defining the time profile
# double_params: vector of real parameters used by the different time-profiles
