# sim_units: normalisation units for the input data
#            it is used only in the input data & log file
#            codes outputs are always in "normalised" units
#            wavelength = input data are in wavelength-related units
#            normalized = input data are put in code (relativistic) units
#
sim_units = wavelength


# dim: Geometry of the simulation
#      1d3v = cartesian grid with 1d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2d3v = cartesian grid with 2d in space + 3d in velocity
#      3d3v = cartesian grid with 3d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2drz = cylindrical (r,z) grid with 3d3v particles
#
dim = 2d3v

# res_time: temporal resolution (integer = number of time−steps within one normalization period)
# sim_time: duration of the simulation in units of the normalization period

# species_type: ion, electron, positron, test ...
# initialization_type: regular, cold or (isotrop) Maxwell−Juettner distribution# n_part_per_cell: number of particle−per−cell
# c_part_max: factor on the memory reserved for the total number of particles
# mass: particle mass in units of the electron mass
# charge: particle charge in units of e (−e is the electron charge)
# density: species density in units of the normalization density
# mean_velocity: mean velocity of the species (3D vector) in units of the light velocity
# temperature: temperature of the species in units of m_e c^2
# dynamics_type: species type of dynamics = norm or rrLL
# time_frozen: time during which the particles are frozen in units of the normalization time
# radiating: boolean, if true incoherent radiation are calculated using the Larmor formula
