.. _TopFromRateIonization:

Ionization using a user-defined rate
------------------------------------

:program:`Smilei` now allows for the treatment of ionization considering a user-defined rate.
The Monte-Carlo procedure behind the treatment of ionization in this case closely follows
that developed for :ref:`field ionization <TopFieldIonization>`.
However, at the moment, only single ionization event per timestep are possible.

The ionization rates are define, for a given ``Species``, as described :ref:`here <Species>`.

Benchmarks
^^^^^^^^^^

In what follows, we present two benchmarks of the ionization using a user-defined rate.
