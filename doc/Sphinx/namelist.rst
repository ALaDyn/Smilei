Write a namelist
----------------

Before you run :program:`Smilei`, you need a *namelist* (an input file). The namelist
is written in the *python* language. It is thus recommended to know the basics of *python*.

To create a namelist, we suggest you copy one existing file in the folder *benchmarks*.
All namelists have the extension ``.py``.

----

General rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The namelist must define variables that :program:`Smilei` will understand.
  For instance, ``timestep = 0.01``.
  All *python* operations are valid. For instance: ``timestep = 40*0.0001``.

* The *python* syntax requires special indentation of each line.
  You begin with no indentation, but you have to **add four spaces at the
  beginning of lines inside a group**, and so on.
  For instance::
    
    if a == 0:
        timestep = 0.1
        if b == 1:
            timestep = 0.2
    else:
        timestep = 0.3
  

* You will need to use `lists <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists>`_,
  which are series of things in *python*,
  defined between brackets ``[]`` and separated by commas.
  For example, ``mean_velocity = [0., 1.1, 3.]``.

* You are free to import any *python* package into the namelist.
  For instance, you may obtain :math:`\pi` using ``from math import pi``.

* All quantities are normalized to arbitrary values: see :doc:`units`.

Stop and restart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. py:data:: dump_step

  :default: 0

  The number of timesteps between each dump of the full simulation.
  If ``0``, no dump is done.
  
.. py:data:: dump_minutes 

  :default: 0.

  The number of minutes between each dump of the full simulation (combines with ``dump_step``).
  If ``0.``, no dump is done.

.. py:data:: exit_after_dump

  :default: ``True``

  If ``True``, the code stops after the dump.

.. py:data:: restart

  :default: ``False``

  If ``True``, :program:`Smilei` finds the last dump file and loads the corresponding simulation.
  If the dump file is not found, an error is raised.

.. py:data:: dump_file_sequence

  :default: 2
  
  This tells :program:`Smilei` to keep the last ``n`` dumps for a later restart 2 is the default option in case the code is stopped (or crashes) during a dump write leading to a unreadable dump file.

.. py:data:: dump_dir

  :default: ""
  
  This tells :program:`Smilei` where to write dump files

.. py:data:: restart_dir

  :default: ""
  
  This tells :program:`Smilei` where to find dump files for restart

An antenna is an extra current applied during the whole simulation.
It is applied using an ``Antenna()`` block, for instance::

  Antenna(
      field = "Jz",

----

.. _profiles:

Profiles
^^^^^^^^

Several quantities require the input of a profile: particle charge, particle density,
external fields, etc. Depending on the case, they can be *spatial* or *temporal*
profiles.

.. rubric:: 1. Constant profiles

* ``Species( ... , charge = -3., ... )`` defines a species with charge :math:`Z^\star=3`.

* ``Species( ... , nb_density = 10., ... )`` defines a species with density :math:`10\,N_r`.
  You can choose ``nb_density`` (*number density*) or ``charge_density``

* ``Species( ... , mean_velocity = [0.05, 0., 0.], ... )`` defines a species
  with drift velocity :math:`v_x = 0.05\,c` over the whole box.

* ``Species(..., initMomentum_type="maxwell-juettner", temperature=[1e-5], ...)`` defines
  a species with a Maxwell-JÃ¼ttner distribution of temperature :math:`T = 10^{-5}\,m_ec^2` over the whole box.
  Note that the temperature may be anisotropic: ``temperature=[1e-5, 2e-5, 2e-5]``.

* ``Species( ... , n_part_per_cell = 10., ... )`` defines a species with 10 particles per cell.

* ``ExtField( field="Bx", profile=0.1 )`` defines a constant external field :math:`B_x = 0.1 B_r`.


.. rubric:: 2. *Python* profiles

..

  Any *python* function can be a profile. You must have basic *python* knowledge to build these functions.
  
  Examples::
  
    def f(x):
        if x<1.: return 0.
        else: return 1.
  
  .. code-block:: python
  
    def f(x,y):    # two variables for 2D simulation
        import math
        twoPI = 2.* math.pi
        return math.cos(  twoPI * x/3.2 )
  
  .. code-block:: python
    
    f = lambda x: x**2 - 1
  
  
  
  Once the function is created, you have to include it in the block you want,
  for example::
  
    Species( ... , charge = f, ... )
    
    Species( ... , mean_velocity = [f, 0, 0], ... )

Walls
^^^^^
Walls can be introduced using a ``PartWall()`` block in order to
reflect, stop, thermalize or kill particles which reach it.
For instance::

  PartWall(
      kind = "refl",
      x = 20.
  )

All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: kind
  
  The kind of wall: ``"refl"``, ``"stop"``, ``"thermalize"`` or ``"supp"``;
  corresponding to a *reflective*, *stopping*, *thermalizing* or *suppressing* wall,
  respectively.
  
.. py:data:: x
             y
             z
  
  Position of the wall in the desired direction. Use only one of ``x``, ``y`` or ``z``.

Moving window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. py:data:: nspace_win_x

  :default: 0
  
  :red:`to do`


.. py:data:: t_move_win

  :default: 0.
  
  :red:`to do`


.. py:data:: vx_win

  :default: 0.
  
  :red:`to do`



----

.. _Collisions:

Collisions
^^^^^^^^^^

To have binary collisions in :program:`Smilei`,
add one or several ``Collisions()`` block in the namelist,
for instance::

  Collisions(
  	species1 = ["electrons1",  "electrons2"],
  	species2 = ["ions1"],
  	coulomb_log = 5.
  )


All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: species1
             species2
  
  Lists of species names (see :py:data:`species_type`).
  
  The collisions will occur between
    1. all species under the list ``species1``
    2. and all species under the group ``species2``
  
  For instance, to have collisions between ``electrons1`` and ``ions1`` , use::
    
    species1 = ["electrons1"], species2 = ["ions1"]

..

  Other example, to collide all electrons with ions::
    
    species1 = ["electrons1", "electrons2"], species2 = ["ions"]

..

  **WARNING: this does not make** ``electrons1`` **collide with** ``electrons2``.
  
  The two groups of species have to be *completely different* OR *exactly equal*.
  In other words, if ``species1`` is not equal to ``species2``,
  then they cannot have any common species.
  If the two groups are exactly equal, we call this situation **intra-collisions**.


.. py:data:: coulomb_log
  
  :default: 0.
  
  The Coulomb logarithm.
  
  * If :math:`= 0`, the Coulomb logarithm is automatically computed for each collision.
  * If :math:`> 0`, the Coulomb logarithm is equal to this value.


.. py:data:: debug_every
  
  :default: 0
  
  | Number of timesteps between each output of information about collisions.
  | If 0, there will be no outputs.


For more details about the collision scheme in :program:`Smilei`, see :doc:`collisions`


----

.. _DiagScalar:

*Scalars* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:program:`Smilei` can collect various scalar data, such as total particle energy, total field energy, etc.
This is done by including the block ``DiagScalar()`` in the namelist, for instance::

  DiagScalar( every = 10 ,
              time_range = [0.1, 1.],
              vars = ["Utot", "Ukin", "Uelm"]
            )

All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: every
  
  Number of timesteps between each output.


.. py:data:: time_range
  
  :default: ``[]``
  
  | List of two values: minimum and maximum times that will be used.
  | Omit this argument to include all times.

.. _DiagFields:

*Fields* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:program:`Smilei` can collect various field data (electromagnetic fields, currents and density)
taken at the location of the PIC grid, both as instantaneous values and averaged values.
This is done with the following instructions in the namelist:

.. py:data:: fieldDump_every
  
  The number of timesteps between each output of the instantaneous fields.

.. py:data:: avgfieldDump_every
  
  The number of timesteps between each output of the time-averaged fields.

.. py:data:: ntime_step_avg
  
  The number of timesteps for time-averaging.

.. py:data:: fieldsToDump
  
  :default: ``[]``
  
  List of field names that are saved. By default, they all are.

.. _DiagProbe:

*Probe* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fields from the previous section are taken at the PIC grid locations,
but it is also possible to obtain the fields at arbitrary locations.
These are called *probes*.

A probe interpolates the fields at either one point (0-D),
several points arranged in a line (1-D) or several points arranged in a mesh (2-D).

To add one probe diagnostic, include the block ``DiagProbe()`` in the namelist.
There are several ways to do it:

**1. For only one point (zero-dimensional probe)**
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every      = ... , # a number
        pos        = [x0, y0, z0]
    )
  
  * ``every`` is the number of timesteps between each output.
  * ``x0 [, y0 [, z0]]`` is the position of the point where to interpolate the fields.
  
  **Note**: ``y0`` (or ``z0``) should only be used in the case of a 2-D (or 3-D) simulation.


**2. For a series of points arranged in a line (one-dimensional probe)**
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every      = ... , # a number
        pos        = [x0, y0, z0],
        pos_first  = [x1, y1, z1],
        number     = [n1]
    )
  
  * ``x0 [, y0 [, z0]]`` is the position of the starting point of the line.
  * ``x1 [, y1 [, z1]]`` is the position of the ending point of the line.
  * ``n1`` is the number of points along this line.

**3. For a series of points arranged in a mesh (two-dimensional probe)**
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every      = ... , # a number
        pos        = [x0, y0, z0],
        pos_first  = [x1, y1, z1],
        pos_second = [x2, y2, z2],
        number     = [n1, n2]
    )
  
  In this case, the three points define three vertices of a paralellogram.


**Notes**

* There is an extra argument ``fields``, a list of fields among ``"Ex"``, ``"Ey"``, ``"Ez"``,
  ``"Bx"``, ``"By"``, ``"Bz"``, ``"Jx"``, ``"Jy"``, ``"Jz"`` and ``"Rho"``. Only these
  fields will be saved. Use, for example, ``fields=["Bz"]`` if you are only interested
  in :math:`B_z`. Note that it does NOT speed up calculation much, but it saves disk space.
* The dimension of the probe is decided only by the instruction ``number``:
  without it, the probe is 0-D, with ``number = [n1]``, the probe is 1-D,
  and with ``number =  [n1, n2]``, the probe is 2-D.
* You can have several probes in the input file.

**Examples of probe diagnostics**

* 0-D probe in 1-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos   = [1.2]
    )

* 1-D probe in 1-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos       = [1.2],
        pos_first = [5.6],
        number    = [100]
    )

* 1-D probe in 2-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos       = [1.2,  4.],
        pos_first = [5.6,  4.],
        number    = [100]
    )

* 2-D probe in 2-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos        = [0. ,   0.],
        pos_first  = [10. ,  0.],
        pos_second = [0.,    10.],
        number     = [100,   100]
    )

.. _DiagParticles:

*Particle* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *particle diagnostic* collects data from the macro-particles and processes them during runtime.
It does not provide information on individual particles: instead, it produces
**averaged quantities** like the particle density, currents, etc.

The data may be collected from one or several particle species.

The data is discretized inside a "grid" chosen by the user. This grid may be of any dimension.

Examples:

* 1-dimensional grid along the position :math:`x` (gives density variation along :math:`x`)
* 2-dimensional grid along positions :math:`x` and :math:`y` (gives density map)
* 1-dimensional grid along the velocity :math:`v_x` (gives the velocity distribution)
* 2-dimensional grid along position :math:`x` and momentum :math:`p_x` (gives the phase-space)
* 1-dimensional grid along the kinetic energy :math:`E_\mathrm{kin}` (gives the energy distribution)
* 3-dimensional grid along :math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`E_\mathrm{kin}` (gives the density map for several energies)
* 1-dimensional grid along the charge :math:`Z^\star` (gives the charge distribution)

Each dimension of the grid is called "axis".

You can add a particle diagnostic by including a block ``DiagParticles()`` in the namelist,
for instance::
  
  DiagParticles(
  	output = "density",
  	every = 5,
  	time_average = 1,
  	species = ["electrons1", "electrons2"],
  	axes = [
  		["x", 0., 10, 100],
  		["ekin", 0.1, 100, 1000, "logscale", "edge_inclusive"]
  	]
  )

All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: output

  determines the data that is summed in each cell of the grid:
  
  * with ``"density"``, the weights are summed.
  * with ``"charge_density"``, the weights :math:`\times` charge are summed.
  * with ``"jx_density"``, the weights :math:`\times` charge :math:`\times\; v_x` are summed (same with :math:`y` and :math:`z`).
  * with ``"p_density"``, the weights :math:`\times\; p` are summed (same with :math:`px`, :math:`py` and :math:`pz`).
  * with ``"pressure_xx"``, the weights :math:`\times\; v \times p` are summed (same with yy, zz, xy, yz and xz).


.. py:data:: every
  
  The number of time-steps between each output.


.. py:data:: time_average
  
  The number of time-steps during which the data is averaged before output.


.. py:data:: species
  
  A list of the names of one or several species (see :py:data:`species_type`).


.. py:data:: axes
  
  A list of "axes" that define the grid.
  
  Syntax of one axis: ``[type, min, max, nsteps, "logscale", "edge_inclusive"]``
  
  * ``type`` is one of ``"x"``, ``"y"``, ``"z"``, ``"px"``, ``"py"``, ``"pz"``, ``"p"``,
    ``"gamma"``, ``"ekin"``, ``"vx"``, ``"vy"``, ``"vz"``, ``"v"`` or ``"charge"``.
  * The axis is discretized for ``type`` from ``min`` to ``max`` in ``nsteps`` bins.
  * The optional keyword ``logscale`` sets the axis scale to logarithmic instead of linear.
  * The optional keyword ``edge_inclusive`` includes the particles outside the range
    [``min``, ``max``] into the extrema bins.
  
  There may be as many axes as wanted in one ``DiagParticles( ... )`` block.

    )

* :math:`x`-:math:`y` density maps for three bands of energy: :math:`[0,1]`, :math:`[1,2]`, :math:`[2,\infty]`.
  Note the use of ``edge_inclusive`` to reach energies up to :math:`\infty`
